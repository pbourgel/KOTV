King of the Visigoths: An abandoned historical fiction game project

King of the Visigoths was an RPG with ASCII graphics, Final Fantasy-style turn based combat, and a basic inventory.  I wrote a simple map editor for the level layouts, the source code of which is included.  The story was loosely based on the third sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 AD as described in Edward Gibbon's "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire", Chapters 29-31.  Most of the project was developed in 2002-3 and abandoned by the spring of 2004.  The timestamps are from December 2004 because I copied the files to a floppy disk and sent it as part of my college application to the University of Maine-Orono.  Hey, it got me into their CS program.

The dev environment for this project was probably DJGPP and Allegro 4.1.x on Windows 98, but the code probably wouldn't take too much effort to run on DOSBox.  If anyone wants to pick up the project, consider the code MIT licensed, and the story licensed under the Creative Commons 4.0 BY.
