King of the Visigoths was meant as an extracurricular programming project, but went inactive a little before I became involved as a Democratic Party activist.  As of this version, features include:

·	A save and load system

·	The beginnings of a battle and item system

·	Control listing

·	Status display

One thing about the source code, I know that the organization is highly wanting (portions of old code commented out, none of the files are divided into modules, etc.), but again, this project is far from complete, and my goal is to demonstrate that I have some experience with C programming.

NOTE: The source code file kotv.c cannot be compiled without the presence of the Allegro game programming library (see http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/)

After the intro, pressing the X key will display the XY coordinates of the main character, I used this so that I could program an event to trigger if the character walked into a certain spot.
